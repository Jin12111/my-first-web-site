    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>Hogwarts Legacy is an action role-playing game in which players are able to attend classes at Hogwarts School of
        Witchcraft and Wizardry. Players can explore locations from the Wizarding World franchise, such as the Forbidden
        Forest, Diagon Alley, and Hogsmeade. Other areas as yet unseen visually in other media include the Hufflepuff
        and Ravenclaw common rooms. Progressing through the game sees the interior and exterior of the castle change
        visually to match the seasons.</p>
