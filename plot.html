    <h2>Plot</h2>
    <p>Fig escorts the protagonist to Hogwarts via a flying coach. When they are attacked by a dragon, they use an
        enchanted key to teleport to Gringotts. Using the key to enter an old vault, the protagonist learns they can see
        ancient magic, and are confronted by Ranrok. Fig and the protagonist escape the goblin, and the protagonist
        begins their term at Hogwarts.

        During the school year, the protagonist reaches an ancient chamber under Hogwarts, where four Keepers—talking
        portraits of past Hogwarts staff—guard the secrets of ancient magic from the wider world. The protagonist learns
        that a previous professor, Isidora Morganach, disagreed with the Keepers on hiding ancient magic, leaving a
        repository of power that Ranrok is attempting to find, as he wishes for goblins to rise up against the wizarding
        world. Ranrok eventually locates Morganach's repository and extracts the ancient power, turning into a dragon;
        after a battle, the protagonist defeats the goblin, and must decide whether to keep the Keepers' secret, or
        reveal the existence of ancient magic.
